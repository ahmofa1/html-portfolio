<h1>The Best Movies According to Ahmad</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>In the name of the father (1993)</h3>

<p>
   This mvoie is very emototinal and inspiring for me at the same time.<br />
   The relationship between daniel Day Lewis and his father, is a very<br />
   good representation of how sons and fathers sometimes don't understand<br />
   each other, and how the Son understands the significance of his father<br />
   after it's too late. I'm also a history nerd so I like movies that show<br />
   interesting times in history, and this movie is based in the times of the<br />
   troubles in Ireland which is a very interesting part of history to me so<br />
   that's also a plus Also can't say no to a Daniel Day-Lewis Movie.

<h3>9 (2009 animated film)</h3>

<p>
    It's a post apocalyptic movie based in the 1940s. It's a very emotional movie<br />
    and it talks about the idea of human life also robots take over the world<br />
    so there's that. This is probably my most favorite animated movie ever and<br />
    it's a very underrated movie that no one talks about.

<h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>

<p>
   I mean I know it's cliche but come on this movie is just the perfect example<br />
   of a good storytelling movie need I say more
